WIP papers provide the opportunity to share early-stage research work that have not yet produced the full results to the community. WIP submissions that showcase only ideas without supporting results will not be accepted. Accepted and registered WiP papers will be published in the conference proceedings and in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library similarly to Regular papers.</description></item></channel></rss>
